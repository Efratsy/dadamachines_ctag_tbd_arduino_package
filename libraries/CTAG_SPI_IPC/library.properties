sentence=A packet-based SPI library for master/slave inter-processor communication (IPC).
paragraph=This library provides a simple but robust solution for inter-processor communication (IPC) over the SPI bus. It implements a master/slave protocol using a custom packet structure with magic bytes, a length field, and a CRC8 checksum to ensure data integrity. The master implementation is platform-independent, while the slave implementation is highly optimized for the ESP32 using DMA and interrupt-driven callbacks.
