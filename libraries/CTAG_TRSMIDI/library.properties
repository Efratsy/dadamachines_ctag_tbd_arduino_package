sentence=A flexible, callback-based library for sending and receiving MIDI messages on Arduino.
paragraph=This library provides a comprehensive, non-blocking interface for handling MIDI I/O. It uses a flexible callback system, allowing you to easily assign functions to handle events like Note On, Note Off, Control Change, Program Change, and Pitch Bend. The library can work with any Arduino Stream object (like Serial, Serial1, or software serial ports) for both sending and receiving messages. It also includes a handy utility to convert MIDI note numbers into human-readable names.
