# dadamachines CTAG TBD ‚Äì Arduino Hardware Package & Libraries

This repository contains the official Arduino **hardware package** and **core libraries** for the [CTAG TBD platform](https://github.com/ctag-fh-kiel/ctag-tbd), developed and maintained by [dadamachines](https://www.dadamachines.com).

It enables easy development for CTAG TBD devices using the Arduino IDE or other compatible environments.

## üì¶ Hardware Support

This package provides official board definitions, tools, and build support for the following platforms:

- **RP2040**: Based on [`arduino-pico`](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico) by Earle F. Philhower, III  
- **ESP32**: Based on the official [`arduino-esp32`](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) core by Espressif Systems

All components are integrated under the unified `dadamachines CTAG TBD` platform.

## üöÄ Installation via Arduino IDE

1. Open the Arduino IDE (version 1.8.x or newer).
2. Go to `File` > `Preferences`.
3. In the **"Additional Board Manager URLs"** field, add:
    ```
    # TO-DO LINK einf√ºgen
    ```
4. Go to `Tools` > `Board` > `Boards Manager...`.
5. Search for **dadamachines**.
6. Click **Install**.
7. After installation, select your board via `Tools > Board > dadamachines CTAG TBD`.
